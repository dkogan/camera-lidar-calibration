This is a LIDAR-camera calibration toolkit using sets of stationary chessboard
observations to calibrate the two sets of sensors together.

* Dependencies
The bulk of this is C code. To build you need to

#+begin_src sh
sudo apt install libmrgingham-dev libdogleg-dev libopencv-dev libpython3-dev
#+end_src

You also need to build the bleeding-edge mrcal tree. The v2.5 series is
recent-enough.

Build and use =clc= like this:

#+begin_src sh
make
PYTHONPATH=$D/mrcal fit.py ....
#+end_src
