Subject: Debian changes

The Debian packaging of camera-lidar-calibration is maintained in git, using a workflow
similar to the one described in dgit-maint-merge(7).
The Debian delta is represented by this one combined patch; there isn't a
patch queue that can be represented as a quilt series.

A detailed breakdown of the changes is available from their canonical
representation -- git commits in the packaging repository.
For example, to see the changes made by the Debian maintainer in the first
upload of upstream version 1.2.3, you could use:

    % git clone https://git.dgit.debian.org/camera-lidar-calibration
    % cd camera-lidar-calibration
    % git log --oneline 1.2.3..debian/1.2.3-1 -- . ':!debian'

(If you have dgit, use `dgit clone camera-lidar-calibration`, rather than plain `git clone`.)

We don't use debian/source/options single-debian-patch because it has bugs.
Therefore, NMUs etc. may nevertheless have made additional patches.
